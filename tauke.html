          after the tragic death of his father, Tauke was elevated by the elders of many clans
          of the Younger and Middle Zhuz to the khan’s throne, being proclaimed the senior khan
          by the steppe younger khans and sultans. At that time, Tauke was awarded the honorary
          military ranks of the nomads subject to him: Bahadur and Gazi.

        <h4 id="khan"> Origin of Kazakh Khanate</h4>
        <p>
          The foreign policy situation of the Kazakh Khanate (in the late XVII - early XVIII centuries)
          was difficult. From the west, the Kazakhs were raided by the Volga Kalmyks and Yaits Cossacks,
          from the north by the Siberian Cossacks, behind the Yaik by the Bashkirs, from the south by Bukhara
          and Khiva, but the main danger came from the east, from the Dzungarian Khanate. The invasion of the
          Dzungars in Kazakhstan was slow and gradual, clashes were replaced by cease-fires. With the coming to
          power of the juntays Galdan-Boshogtu (1670-1677), the aggressive campaigns intensified. Tauke Khan could
          not stop the Dzhungars, and in 1681 Goldan's troops crossed the Chu River. From 1681 to 1685, Galdan Boshogtu
          made seven military campaigns against the southern Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and the urban population of Sairam and Andijan
          to force them to accept Lamaism instead of Islam. In 1683, in one of the battles, the son of Khan Tauke was
          captured. He returned to his lands only after 14 years thanks to the interested mediation of the new
          head of the Dzungaria - Tsavan Rabdan. In 1710, Kurultai gathered in the Karakum region. The largest
          military campaigns of the Dzungars within the Kazakh nomads took place in 1711-1712, 1714, 1717, 1723 and 1725.
          The period from 1723-1726 is marked as the "years of great disaster." In 1718, the Dzhungars embarked on a
          rapid campaign from the territory of the lands in Semirechye to the Syr Darya. Their goal was to seize the
          headquarters of the Kazakh khans, whose power by that time only formally extended to all three zhuzes, downstream
          the Syr Darya to the Aral Sea. Soon after the death of Tauke Khan, all three zhuzes had their khans. Since then,
          the zhuzes have turned into independent khanates.

          In the 90s. XVII century In addition to the nomadic regions of Kazakhstan, the sphere of political influence also
          spread to trade and craft centers and settled agricultural oases along the course of the Syr Darya. During the reign
          of Tauke, in these 32 cities with adjoining agricultural villages, the younger khans and sultans ruled, who paid in
          favor of the state treasury an annual fee in money and goods, and the agricultural and urban population levied a cash
          collection from the stock of cows and sheep and a grain duty of tithing harvested. Tauke Khan is considered the founder
          of the common law of the Kazakhs, since it was under him that the finalization of the legal system of the Kazakh society
          took place. The first major change Tauke introduced into the system of power relations. He streamlined the activities
          of the biys, making the meeting of the biys council permanent and regular. Biysk councils have become an important state
          body that provides direct and feedback in the system of power relations. Thus, the authority of the authorities among the
          common people was growing rapidly, which allowed to dynamically develop the political situation in the country.
