        <p>
          According to the pedigree of Abu l-Ghazi, Kassym Khan was the son of one of the founders of the Kazakh Khanate -
          Zhanibek Khan and was a descendant of the thirteenth son of Jochi Khan - Tuk-Timur. His mother, Jagan-begim, was
          the sister of the mother of Mahmud-Sultan, brother of Sheybani Khan [2] According to the Tarih-i-Rashidi after Kerei
          Khan, his son Burunduk Khan inherited power in the Kazakh Khanate [3]. At the same time, in the sources describing the
          period of the reign of Burunduk Khan, the names of several Kazakh sultans are also mentioned, among which the most
          authoritative was the son of Zhanibek Khan - Kasym-Sultan, who wandered around Lake Balkhash and the Karatal River.

        <p>
          The Kazakh sultans and other representatives of the nobility supported Kasym, as he was lucky in every military campaign
          and captured military booty for the nobility, especially he distinguished himself in battles with Muhammad Sheybani Khan,
          who tried to capture the southern regions of Desht-i-Kipchak, therefore his authority it grew so much that without a khanâ€™s
          title, he actually possessed power comparable to that of a khan, and the legal khan Burunduk was not popular with the people.
          Therefore, according to the information of Muhammad Haidar, the year 915 of the Hijra (1509/1510), although Burunduk was a khan,
          the reign of the khanate and the fullness of power belonged to Kassym then the sultan. Kasym Sultan, having actually gained power
          in the khanate as a far-sighted politician, he was cautious, knew how to patiently wait where, it would seem, the situation
          accelerates the resolution of the issue. In 1510, when the Sheybanids raided the Kasym ulus, he, according to Mirza Muhammad
          Haidar Dulati. According to Muhammad Haidar, the number of Kasim Khan's subordinates reached a million people, while the Burunduk
          Khan was inferior in military strength to Kasym. Kasym, commanding the Kazakh troops, distinguished himself in battles with Muhammad
          Sheybani Khan, who tried to capture the southern regions of Desht-i-Kipchak. Although Burunduk continued to be considered the main khan,
          the power of Kasym was so great that, as Muhammad Khaidar believed, no one thought about Burunduk. It is known that the defeated Burunduk
          was expelled from the steppe and died in a foreign land in Samarkand.

        <h4 id="end"> End of life</h4>
        <p>
          According to Muhammad Haidar, Kasym Khan died in 924 of the Hijra (1518). Gaffari in "Jahan-ara" reports the year of death - 930 year of the hijra.
          According to V.V. Trepavlova died and was buried in 1521 in Saraichik, the capital of the Nogai Horde that he had seized.
          According to other sources, he died in the winter of 1521 at the age of seventy-six years.
          According to the author of the beginning of the XVII century. Kadyrgali Kosym ouly Jalairi, Kassym Khan died in Saraichik, on the banks of the Ural
          River. He was buried in the ancient pantheon of the Golden Horde khans.
